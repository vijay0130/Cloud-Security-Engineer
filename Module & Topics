1. Introduction to Cloud Security	Core cloud 
concepts, cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), deployment models (public, private, hybrid, community), threats & vulnerabilities in cloud, cloud provider architecture, shared responsibility model, risk considerations, securing the baseline environment.

2. Platform & Infrastructure Security in Cloud	
Virtualization, containerization, hypervisor security, securing the host / guest OS, network virtualization, securing physical and logical infrastructure, segmentation, zero trust, defense in depth, infrastructure services in AWS/Azure/GCP, security for compute, network, control plane. 

3. Application Security in Cloud	
Cloud application security, secure SDLC adjustments for cloud, code scanning, container security, serverless security, API security, WAF, runtime protection, secrets management. 

4. Data Security in Cloud	
Data lifecycle, classification, encryption (at rest, in transit, in use), key management, tokenization, masking, secure storage, database security, cloud-native data services, backup, data integrity, data access controls. 

5. Operational / Security Operations in Cloud	
Logging, monitoring, SIEM, alerting, intrusion detection/prevention, security automation, change / patch management, infrastructure as code (IaC) security, orchestration, drift detection, configuration management, vulnerability management. 

6. Cloud Penetration Testing	
Cloud vulnerability assessment, penetration testing against cloud infrastructure / services, enumeration of services, privilege escalation, lateral movement in cloud, attacking misconfigurations in IAM, storage, networking. Tools and techniques specific to AWS/Azure/GCP.
7. Incident Response in Cloud	
Cloud IR process/lifecycle, detection vs response, SOAR in cloud, playbooks, containment and eradication in cloud, coordination with CSP, forensic readiness, leveraging cloud logging trails. 

8. Forensic Investigation in Cloud	
Cloud forensics challenges (ephemeral resources, snapshotting, logs), evidence collection in cloud (snapshots, storage, logs, network captures), chain of custody, forensic toolchains, time synchronization, memory dump, cross-region forensics.
9. Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery in Cloud	
RTO / RPO, designing redundant architectures, multi-region / multi-AZ, backup strategies, replication, failover, recovery drills, continuity planning in cloud. 

10. Governance, Risk, & Compliance (GRC) in Cloud	
Risk assessments, threat modeling, governance frameworks, cloud risk frameworks, compliance in cloud (e.g. PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR, ISO controls), audit controls, cloud security policies, operations compliance. 

11. Standards, Policies & Legal Issues in Cloud	
Standards (ISO, NIST, CSA, etc.), legal & regulatory topics (data residency, cross-border, SLAs, liabilities), policy writing, contracts with CSPs, audit and assurance, reporting.
